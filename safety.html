        <h1>Home Safety</h1>
        <p>Ensuring children's safety at home is paramount. To create a secure environment, parents can take several proactive measures.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
            <div class="col-s-10">
                <p class="header">These are all the proactive measures you can do to make your house safer for you and your child/children.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Put non-choking hazard safety plugs in all unused electrical outlets.</li>
                    <p>This protects against electric shock by preventing your child from being able to stick their finger or a toy into the holes. If your child won't stay away from outlets, block access to them with furniture. Keep electrical cords out of reach and sight. Install ground-fault circuit interrupters where appropriate.</p>
                    <br>

                    <li>Avoid window coverings that have cords to prevent strangulation.</li>
                    <p>If your blinds or drapes are not cordless, attach their cords to floor mounts that hold them taut. Or, wrap these cords around wall brackets to keep them out of reach. Use safety stop devices on the cords. Cords with loops should be cut and equipped with safety tassels.</p>
                    <br>

                    <li>Check floors constantly for small objects that can be dangerous if a child swallows them.</li>
                    <p>Examples include coins, beads, buttons, pins and pills, which can cause choking or poisoning. The best way to check is to get down at your child's level and see what's there. This is extra important if someone has a hobby that involves small items, or if there are older children who have small toys or other items.</p>
                    <br>

                    <li>Check furniture for stability and tip-over risk.</li>
                    <p>Children can be seriously hurt or even killed when they children climb onto, fall against or pull themselves up on large pieces of furniture like bookshelves and dressers. Put floor lamps behind other furniture and anchor bookcases, dressers and TV stands to the wall. Also keep computers out of reach to so your child can't pull them onto themselves or get entangled in the cords.</p>
                    <br>

                    <li>To prevent falls from windows, open windows from the top if possible.</li>
                    <p>If you must open them from the bottom, install operable window guards that only an adult or older child can open from the inside. A screen is not strong enough to prevent a fall. Never put chairs, sofas, low tables or anything else a child might climb on in front of a window.</p>
                    <br>

                    <li>Think about the potential hazard of anything you put into the trash.</li>
                    <p>Any trash container used for possibly dangerous items—spoiled food, discarded razor blades batteries—should have a child-resistant cover or be kept out of a child's reach.</p>
                    <br>

                    <li>To prevent burns, check fireplaces, woodstoves, kerosene heaters and other heat sources in your home.</li>
                    <p>These should be screened so that your child can't get near them. Gas fireplaces with glass doors get extremely hot and can cause severe burns when touched. Check electric baseboard heaters, radiators, and even vents from hot-air furnaces to see how hot they get. They, too, may need to be screened.</p>
                    <br>

                    <li>Put safety locks on all cabinets containing cleaning fluids or other dangerous items.</li>
                    <p>Also keep all medications (including those you might carry in your purse) out of reach. Do not depend on child safety caps to protect your child from getting into medicine bottles.</p>
                    <br>

                    <li>Check for furniture with hard edges and sharp corners that could injure your child (coffee tables are a particular hazard).</li>
                    <p>If possible, remove dangerous furniture from traffic areas, particularly when your child is learning to walk. You also can buy cushioned corner- and edge-protectors that stick onto the furniture.</p>
                    <br>

                    <li>Know which items your home have button or lithium coin batteries and keep them out of reach of children.</li>
                    <p>When inhaled or swallowed, these small batteries can cause swift, life-threatening damage to the esophagus or intestines. They are found in many common household and personal products, such as small remote controls, key fobs, cameras, garage door openers, flameless candles, watches, toys and hearing aids.</p>
